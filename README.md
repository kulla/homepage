# My Homepage

This is my personal homepage at https://kulla.dev. It is handwritten HTML & CSS
which you can find in the [`src/`](./src) folder.

## Local Development

### Setup

I use [`bun`](https://bun.sh/) for local development. To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### Start a local server

To run a local server and view the homepage in your browser at
http://localhost:3000, run:

```bash
bun run dev
```
